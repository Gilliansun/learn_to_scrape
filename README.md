# Learn to scrape 

Materials for MIT Methods Lab workshop on learning to scrape web pages

## Preperation

We'll be using Python 3 for this workshop. Python 3 has much better support
than 2 for different character encodings in text, which is something that comes
up quite often in web scraping.

Please install the Anaconda distribution of Python 3 and Jupyter notebook from
the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/?lang=en-us#macos) site. For
more details, see @soubhikbarari's instructions
[here](https://github.com/soubhikbarari/MITPolMeth-PythonDataSci-02-2018/blob/master/setup.pdf),
but making sure to install Python 3.

Anaconda should automatically have all of the needed packages pre-installed.
Please verify that they are by:

1. downloading this repository (the button is on the upper right of the page)
2. launching Jupyter using @soubhikbarari's instructions
3. opening the `.ipynb` notebook 
4. running each of the cells with `import` in them to verify the packages load

## Contents

`Scraper_Skeleton.ipynb` contains a skeleton of a web scraper and is what we'll
be working through during the workshop.
